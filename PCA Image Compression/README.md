# Applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- This folder contains the supplementary code to my article [Applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://iq.opengenus.org/applications-of-pca/) on OpenGenus IQ.

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental algorithms for dimension reduction and is a foundation stone in Machine Learning. 

- Mentioned in this folder is the code to one of the  applications: [Image Compression using PCA](https://github.com/yashml/OpenGenus_Articles_Code/blob/master/Applications%20of%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(PCA)/Image_Compression_PCA.ipynb).

- The input is the OpenGenus logo and the amount of variance preserved for different number of Principal Components is mentioned below:
